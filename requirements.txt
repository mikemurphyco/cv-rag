# CV-RAG Dependencies (n8n-Native Approach)
# ===========================================

# REQUIRED - Streamlit frontend
streamlit==1.40.2
pandas==2.2.3
requests==2.32.3
python-dotenv==1.0.1

# DEPRECATED - No longer needed for n8n-native approach
# These were used in the old Python-based implementation
# Kept in file for reference, but not needed to install
#
# langchain==0.3.7                  # Replaced by n8n LangChain nodes
# langchain-text-splitters==0.3.2   # Replaced by n8n Recursive Text Splitter node
# sentence-transformers==3.3.1      # Replaced by Ollama nomic-embed-text
# psycopg2-binary==2.9.10           # Replaced by n8n Postgres Vector Store node
# pgvector==0.3.6                   # Replaced by n8n Postgres Vector Store node
# flask==3.0.0                      # Replaced by n8n calling Ollama directly

# NOTE: For the n8n-native approach, the heavy lifting happens in n8n workflows:
# - Document chunking: n8n Recursive Text Splitter node
# - Embeddings: n8n Embeddings Ollama node (calls VPS Ollama API)
# - Vector storage: n8n Postgres Vector Store node
# - LLM generation: n8n Ollama Chat Model node
#
# Python is only used for the Streamlit frontend and optional testing scripts.
